This project was made for my Computer Graphics subject as final project.
If anybody is reading this, I hope you enjoy playing this game.
My highest score is 5700, bet you won't beat it.


CONTROLS
WASD - Control the cannon
LShift - Zoom 
SPACEBAR - Shoot cannon
ESC - Pause


INSTALLATION
There's only two things you need to do in order to play the game.
1. Download the project's repository on any folder you prefer.
2. Open the game via a local server, otherwise it won't load any textures. 

This can be done with python2 with the following commands:
- Open Windows SHELL
- Move to the game's folder destination
- Enter the following command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
- Open in chrome with localhost:8000/
- Open the game's folder and double click on asteroidKiller.html


Easier method using Visual Studio Code and Live Server extension:
- Open the game's folder
- Right click on asteroidKiller.html
- Select "Open with Live Server"
And it will open in chrome by itself!
