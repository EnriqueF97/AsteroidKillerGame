CONTROLS

SPACEBAR - Shoot cannon
ESC - Pause


INSTALLATION
There's only two things you need to do in order to play the game.
1. Download the project's repository on any folder you prefer.
2. Open the game via a local server, otherwise it won't load any textures. 

Easier method using Visual Studio Code and Live Server extension:
- Open the game's folder
- Right click on asteroidKiller.html
- Select "Open with Live Server"
And it will open in chrome by itself!

This can also be accomplished with python2 with the following commands:
- Open Windows SHELL
- Move to the game's folder destination
- Enter the following command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
- Open in chrome with localhost:8000/
- Open the game's folder and double click on asteroidKiller.html
